        <h2>Still very wild!</h2>
        <p>
          Kangaroo Island is an island off the coast near Adelaide, South
          Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an area of 4405km<sup>2</sup> and a population density of
          1.07/km<sup>2</sup>, the island has about half the population density
          of areas such as Siberia and Western Sahara. And it shows! Outside of
          the main port town and a few other towns, you will be seeing vast
          amounts of untouched nature, as well as the scars of wildfires.
        </p>
        <p>
          All images on this page are from my own trip to Adelaide and Kangaroo
          Island in particular in May 2023.

        <h2>History</h2>
      </section>

      <section class="content">
        <h2>A long history of isolation.</h2>
        <p>
          The last known Aboriginal presence on the island disappeared over 2000
          years ago, and between then and its early settlement in the 19th
          century and eventual permanent colonization in 1836, there was no
          human presence on the island as far as we know today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like Australia in general, the island did and still has a wide
          variety of endemic flora and fauna that can't be found anywhere else.
          From the self-explanatory Kangaroo Island Kangaroo, to an unique
          species of honeybee that makes it extremely illegal to bring foreign
          honey or other bee-related products to the island.

        <h2>Some Landmarks</h2>
      </section>

      <section class="content">
        <h2>Many sights to see!</h2>
        <p>
          There's many unique sights to see and things to experience on the
          island, and the local population will more than likely be eager to
          give you ideas!
        </p>
        <p>
          There's the Remarkable Rocks, an unique collection of rock formations
          eroded out of solid rock over the last 500 million years.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's the Admiral's Arch, a natural arch hollowed out by the often
          rough sea hitting the shore on that side of the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there's also opportunities to get up close and personal to a
          colony of seals in Seal Bay, a honey farm that will do a good job at
          convincing you to bring some of their unique honey home and much more.

        <h2>How to get there?</h2>

      <section class="content">
        <h2>Enjoy the Fleurieu Peninsula on the way!</h2>
        <p>
          I can only speak for the route I took, but I'm very happy with it!
        </p>
        <p>
          There's many other wonderful destinations along the Fleurieu Peninsula
          south of Adelaide while on the way to Port Jarvis, where you can take
          the ferry from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially Port Elliot and the nearby Victor Harbor are wonderful calm
          seaside towns, with many options for a place to stay over the night as
          long as one orders in advance. And it's recommended, as the trip from
          Adelaide all the way to Port Jarvis is a long one!
