# Portfolio

Home page made while attending Kodelofted at Fontenehuset Bergen.
Features HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Sub-projects include
- The html layout of the site itself.
- A webpage using the Parallax effect featuring pictures taken by me :)
- A celsius/fahrenheit/kelving converter using Javascript and especially DOM manipulation.
- A to-do list done in Javascript using DOM manipulation and LocalStorage.

  Future projects might get added to this unless they outgrow it.
  Current ideas mostly include an attempt at a text adventure game via Javascript (no clue if this is a bad idea!) and setup randomizers for games I play (thanks for the idea Julie!)
