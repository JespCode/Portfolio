Home page made while attending Kodeloftet at Fontenehuset Bergen.
Features HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Sub-projects include

- The html layout of the site itself.
- A webpage using the Parallax effect featuring pictures taken by me.
- A celsius/fahrenheit/kelvin converter + a miles/kilometer converter using Javascript and especially DOM manipulation.
- A to-do list done in Javascript using DOM manipulation and LocalStorage.

  Future projects might get added to this unless they outgrow it.
